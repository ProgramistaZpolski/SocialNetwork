# SocialNetwork

This is really simple social network page. It's still in beta, report issues through Issues page.
It contains ready-to-put files to your website. It works without (any required) configuration!

If you want to test it out though, go to http://itstotallynotwebsite.rf.gd/socialnetwork/ so you can mess around with it.

# Branch v1.1b update:

New version of SN released, I will keep first release though. New version contains:

- Every post get its own ID.
- You can embed posts (embed.php?id=PostIDHere).
- New warning if user is not logged in (noaccount.html).

It's avaiable at: http://itstotallynotwebsite.rf.gd/socialnetwork/v1.1/
